# PollDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.0.

## Remarks

I found the requirement to disable inputs if the text is longer then 80 chars to be weird. Normally I would advice against or try to clarify if I understand the requirement correctly. By disabling the input when the text is too long we're preventing the user from correcting the input - the only options is to reload the page.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
